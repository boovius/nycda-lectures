- Homework:
 - create a navbar use floats (try float right) and clearfix
 - use display inline-block to create a small image gallery (the images can be simple divs with different bg colors)
 - create a fixed sidebar
 - absolutely position a footer to the bottom of the document
 - below the image gallery, offset a 'parent' div 100 px to the right and down of where it would sit in the normal flow of the document with relative positioning
 - absolutely position a 'child' div to the top-right of the 'parent' div
